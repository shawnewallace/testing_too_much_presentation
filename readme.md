**STOP! You’re automating too much!** (and other tales from the field)

Functional test automation has many advantages, but operating at scale highlights various limitations that are hard to anticipate. A wide range of questions are discussed as well as some patterns and practices that will make implementing functional test automation in a team easier.

Questions discussed include:

* How do I get started?
* What should I automate?
* How do I collect the data?
* How do I run my tests when no one is around?
* Do I always need to run all of my tests?
* Do I need to keep my tests forever?
* Where does automation fit in the cadence of the team?

In this session we’ll discuss these questions and some additional practical lessons learned from several years of building solutions that leverage test automation in both large and small environments.

```csharp
for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
    Console.Writeline("=>" + i.ToString());
}
