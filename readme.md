**STOP! You’re automating too much!** (and other tales from the field)

Test automation has many advantages. It is a useful but imperfect practice with limitations that are hard to anticipate in a new project. There are many questions that teams find themselves asking throughout a project’s lifecycle:

* How do I get started?
* What should I automate?
* How do I collect the data?
* How do I run my tests when no one is around?
* Do I always need to run all of my tests?
* Do I need to keep my tests forever?
* Where does automation fit in the cadence of the team?

In this session we’ll discuss these questions and some additional practical lessons learned from several years of building solutions that leverage test automation in both large and small environments.

```csharp
for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
    Console.Writeline("=>" + i.ToString());
}
```
